    <h1>Spider-Man(Comic Character) brief:</h1>
    <p>
      Spider-Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by
      Marvel Comics. Created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko,
      he first appeared in the anthology comic book Amazing Fantasy #15 (August
      1962) in the Silver Age of Comic Books. He has since been featured in
      movies, television shows, video games, and plays. Spider-Man is the alias
      of Peter Parker, an orphan raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New
      York City after his parents Richard and Mary Parker died in a plane crash.
      Lee and Ditko had the character deal with the struggles of adolescence and
      financial issues and gave him many supporting characters, such as Flash
      Thompson, J. Jonah Jameson and Harry Osborn, romantic interests Gwen
      Stacy, Mary Jane Watson and the Black Cat, and foes such as Doctor
      Octopus, the Green Goblin and Venom. In his origin story, he gets
      spider-related abilities from a bite from a radioactive spider; these
      include clinging to surfaces, superhuman strength and agility, and
      detecting danger with his "spider-sense." He also builds wrist-mounted
      "web-shooter" devices that shoot artificial spider webs of his own design.
