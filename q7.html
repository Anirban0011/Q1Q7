    <p><b>Artificial Intelligence: </b></p>
    <p>
      Artificial intelligence is a field of computer science which makes a
      computer system that can mimic human intelligence. It is comprised of two
      words "Artificial" and "intelligence", which means "a human-made thinking
      power." Hence we can define it as, "Artificial intelligence is a
      technology using which we can create intelligent systems that can simulate
      human intelligence". The Artificial intelligence system does not require
      to be pre-programmed, instead of that, they use such algorithms which can
      work with their own intelligence. It involves machine learning algorithms
      such as Reinforcement learning algorithm and deep learning neural
      networks. AI is being used in multiple places such as Siri, Google?s
      AlphaGo, AI in Chess playing, etc.

    <p><b>Machine Learning: </b></p>
    <p>
      Machine learning is about extracting knowledge from the data. It can be
      defined as, "Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence,
      which enables machines to learn from past data or experiences without
      being explicitly programmed". Machine learning enables a computer system
      to make predictions or take some decisions using historical data without
      being explicitly programmed. Machine learning uses a massive amount of
      structured and semi-structured data so that a machine learning model can
      generate accurate result or give predictions based on that data. Machine
      learning works on algorithm which learn by it?s own using historical data.
      It works only for specific domains such as if we are creating a machine
      learning model to detect pictures of dogs, it will only give result for
      dog images, but if we provide a new data like cat image then it will
      become unresponsive. Machine learning is being used in various places such
      as for online recommender system, for Google search algorithms, Email spam
      filter, Facebook Auto friend tagging suggestion, etc.
