      attempt to make Morbius happen."Metacritic assigned the film a weighted
      average score of 37 out of 100 based on 48 critics, indicating "generally
      unfavorable reviews".

      Among the film's positive reviews, Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly
      gave the film a B grade, saying that Leto "hits the right notes of fear
      and longing in a surprisingly restrained performance",while Stephanie
      Zacharek of Time felt that Leto's performance has a "quietly vibrating
      vulnerability".Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle awarded the
      film a 3 out of 4 and called the film "briskly riveting" and a "perfect
      antidote to bloated The Batman".Chris Bumbray of JoBlo.com gave the film a
      6 out of 10 and called it "a decent enough start for the latest addition
      to the Sony Spider-Man Universe" while also praising the cinematography
      and "horror aspects" of the plot.

        <i>David Rooney via Hollywood Reporter: </i> After his bizarrely
        cartoonish turn in House of Gucci, it’s a relief to see Jared Leto
        channel his lust for transformative characters into a film where that’s
        quite literally written into the role’s DNA. He plays the title figure
        in Morbius, known as “The Living Vampire” in the Marvel comics from
        whence he hails. Leto gets to juggle time as the brilliant Dr. Michael
        Morbius — who has spent his life searching for a cure for the rare fatal
        blood disease that afflicts him — with the blood-sucking monster he
        becomes, which fills his soul with horror.

        <i>Emma Kiely via Collider</i>With Marvel churning out content like a
        cow produces milk, it's been hard to believe how they still bring fresh
        and nuanced stories to the table — like Spider-Man: No Way Home or
        Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. However, the superhero studio
        has finally caught up with itself in its latest tandem release with
        Sony, as Morbius is one of its most stale, unoriginal, and forgettable
        outings. From start to finish, the film feels completely rushed. We get
        barely any backstory into the protagonist we are meant to empathize with
        through the entire picture. We know little about Dr. Michael Morbius.
        The film tries to give us a character that we can identify with as he
        cares for young children and tries to cure his best friend, but it all
        feels like filler, just waiting for the action to start.

        <i>Manohla Dargis via The New York Times:</i>My, what sharp teeth he has
        — and what lovely skin, too. One of the revelations of “Morbius” — the
        latest movie to take a marginal Marvel character out of mothballs for
        his blockbuster close-up — is that regular blood smoothies do wonders
        for the skin. To judge by the chiseled planes of Morbius’s arms and
        torso, pounding shots of the slurpy stuff also builds muscles much
        faster than mainlining anabolic steroids can.
